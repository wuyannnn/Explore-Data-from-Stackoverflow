## Installation 

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 and 2018 to better understand:
1. Compared to 2017, how the trend of commonly used programming languages is changing? which one is getting more favored?
2. How the propotion of male and female programmers look like?
3. Where are the respondents from, how it changes over time?

## File Descriptions 
There are 1 notebooks, 1 readme file and 2 csv data available here.
The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
Another 2 survey data can't be uploaded because of the size limitation are available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).


## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://www.cnblogs.com/wuyannnn/articles/10126760.html).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
